# # Tutorial: missing value handling
#
# This tutorial illustrates the usage of Transducers.jl by stepping
# through various handling of missing values.

using Transducers

# ## Dot product
#
# Here is a simple way to compute a dot product using
# [`mapfoldl`](@ref) and [`MapSplat`](@ref):

mapfoldl(MapSplat(*), +, zip(1:3, 10:2:14))

# Let's see what it does step by step.  First we create a "printer"
# transducer using this function (see [`Map`](@ref)):

xf_printer(label) = Map() do x
    println(label, ": ", x)
    return x  # just return it as-is
end
nothing  # hide

# This transducer just pass-through the input while printing its value
# (prefixed by a `label`).  Let's sandwich the previous `MapSplat(*)`
# with it:

mapfoldl(
    xf_printer(" input") |> MapSplat(*) |> xf_printer("output"),
    +, zip(1:3, 10:2:14))
flush(stdout)  # hide

# You can see that the input tuple `(1, 10)` is splatted into function
# `*` by `MapSplat` which then outputs `10`.  This is repeated for all
# inputs.

# Perhaps unfortunately, this way of computing a dot product
# propagates any missing values contained in the input arrays to the
# result (which may actually be desired in certain cases).

xs = [1, missing, 3, 2]
ys = [10, 14, missing, 12]
mapfoldl(MapSplat(*), +, zip(xs, ys))

# However, it is very simple to ignore any missing values using
# [`NotA`](@ref):

xf_mdot = MapSplat(*) |> NotA(Missing)
mapfoldl(xf_mdot, +, zip(xs, ys))

#src Make sure this comment is correct:
#src
#src # (You may think filtering out missing values after computing the
#src # multiplication.  However, it looks like the Julia compiler optimizes
#src # out the "dead code" and makes it efficient.)

# ## Covariance
#
# This transducer `xf_mdot` can also be used to compute the
# covariance.  First, we need the number of pairs of elements in `xs`
# and `ys` that _both_ of them are not `missing`:

nonmissings = mapfoldl(xf_mdot |> Count(), right, zip(xs, ys); init=0)
#-
@assert nonmissings == 2  # hide

# We do this by using [`Count`](@ref) and [`right`](@ref).  `Count`
# ignores input and count the number of times the input is provided.
# Since `xf_mdot` provides the inputs to the downstream transducer,
# this correctly counts the number of non-missing pairs.  Function
# `right` is simply defined as `right(l, r) = r` (and `right(r) = r`).
# Thus, the whole `mapfoldl` returns the last output of `Count`.  In
# case `Count` never gets called (i.e., there are no non-missing
# pairs), we pass `init=0`.

ans =  # hide
mapfoldl(xf_mdot |> Count(), right, zip(Int[], Int[]); init=0)
#-
@assert ans == 0  # hide

# Finally, we have to pre-process the input to `xf_mdot` by
# subtracting the average.  It's easy to do with `Map`:

using Statistics: mean

function xf_demean(xs, ys)
    xmean = mean(skipmissing(xs))
    ymean = mean(skipmissing(ys))
    return Map(((x, y),) -> (x - xmean, y - ymean))
end

mapfoldl(xf_demean(xs, ys) |> xf_mdot, +, zip(xs, ys)) / nonmissings

# ## Addition
#
# How do we use transducers for vector-to-vector transformation?  Here
# is a function to calculate ``y = x + y`` while ignoring missing
# values in ``x``.

function add_skipmissing!(ys, xs)
    length(ys) == length(xs) || error("length(ys) != length(xs)")

# For filtering out missing values from `xs` while tracking indices,
# we use [`Zip`](@ref).  To iterate over the output of the transducer,
# [`foreach`](@ref) is used instead of [`mapfoldl`](@ref) since
# mutating an array is better expressed as a side-effect than a fold.

    foreach(Zip(Count(), NotA(Missing)), xs) do (i, xi)
        @inbounds ys[i] += xi
    end

# !!! warning
#
#     Note the difference between `Zip(Count(), NotA(Missing))` and
#     `Zip(NotA(Missing), Count())` in Transducers.jl.  The former
#     enumerates all the elements in `xs` while the latter enumerates
#     _only_ non-missing values.

# We then return the mutated value to behave like the rest of Julia
# functions (`push!`, `mul!`, etc.):

    return ys
end
nothing  # hide

# Example:

ans =  # hide
add_skipmissing!([100, 110, 120], [1, missing, 2])
#-
@assert ans == [101, 110, 122]  # hide

# ## Vectorized reduction
#
# `foldl`, `mapfoldl`, etc. in `Base` support `dims` argument.
# However, this can easily be emulated using `eachcol`, `eachrow`, or
# `eachslice` iterators in `Base`.

xs = [
    0       missing 1       2
    3       4       5       missing
    missing 6       7       missing
]

function xf_sum_columns(prototype)
    T = Base.nonmissingtype(eltype(prototype)) # subtract Missing from type
    dims = size(prototype)
    return Scan(add_skipmissing!, Initializer(_ -> zeros(T, dims)))
end
nothing  # hide

# We use [`Initializer`](@ref) here to allocate the "output array"
# into which the columns are added by `add_skipmissing!`.

ans =  # hide
mapfoldl(xf_sum_columns(xs[:, 1]), right, eachcol(xs))
#-
@assert ans == [3, 12, 13]  # hide

# Above computation returns the sum over each row without taking into
# account the relationship within a column.  Another possibly useful
# reduction is the sum of the columns with no missing values.  This
# can easily be done by prepending a filter:

ans =  # hide
mapfoldl(Filter(x -> !any(ismissing, x)) |> xf_sum_columns(xs[:, 1]),
         right, eachcol(xs))
#md ans  # hide
#src `#md ans` is a hack to avoid Literate.jl to put `continued = true`.
#-
@assert ans == [1, 5, 7]  # hide

# Note that above combination of `Scan` and `right` is redundant.  For
# example, we can simply pass `add_skipmissing!` to "normal" `foldl`:

ans =  # hide
foldl(add_skipmissing!, eachcol(xs), init=zeros(Int, size(xs, 1)))
#-
@assert ans == [3, 12, 13]  # hide

# However, packaging it as a transducer is sometimes useful as it can
# be composed with other transducers and "bottom" reducing function.
# For example, vectorized version of `cumsum` can easily obtained by
# composing it with `append!` (and then `reshape` after `mapfoldl`):

result = mapfoldl(
    xf_sum_columns(xs[:, 1]),
    Completing(append!),
    eachcol(xs);
    init = Int[])
ans =  # hide
reshape(result, (size(xs, 1), :))
#-
@assert ans == [      # hide
    0  0   1   3      # hide
    3  7  12  12      # hide
    0  6  13  13      # hide
]                     # hide

# Note that we need [`Completing`](@ref) here since `append!` does not
# have the unary method used for [`complete`](@ref
# Transducers.complete) protocol.

# ## Argmax
#
# Another useful operation to do ignoring missing values is
# `argmax`/`argmin`.  It can be implemented as `Zip(Count(), ...)`
# (see also `add_skipmissing!` above) composed with
# [`ScanEmit`](@ref):

xf_argmax(xf_filter = NotA(Missing)) =
    Zip(Count(), xf_filter) |> ScanEmit(argmax_step, (0, typemin(Int)))
##                                                     |
##                                              initial state (see below)
nothing  # hide

# where `argmax_step` passed to `ScanEmit` is defined as:

##                     ,--- current state
##                     |
##                     |              ,-- input
##                     |              |
function argmax_step((argmax, max), (index, value))
    argmax, max = value > max ? (index, value) : (argmax, max)
    return argmax, (argmax, max)
    ##       \        \
    ##        \        \__ next state
    ##         \
    ##          \__ output
end
nothing  # hide

# As [`ScanEmit`](@ref) is one of the most complex (and powerful)
# transducer, it may require some comments on how above code works:
#
# * The state `(argmax, max)` is initialized to `(0, typemin(Int))` in
#   `xf_argmax`.  This is the first value passed to the first argument
#   `(argmax, max)` of `argmax_step`.
#
# * The upstream transducer `Zip(Count(), xf_filter)` provides
#   `(index, value)`-pair which becomes the input (the second
#   argument) of `argmax_step`.
#
# * Function `argmax_step` must return a pair.  The first item becomes
#   the output of `ScanEmit`.  In this case that's the index of the
#   largest item seen so far.
#
# * The second item in the returned pair is fed back to `argmax_step`
#   in the next call.
#
# We have the argmax function by extracting the last output of
# `xf_argmax`:

mapfoldl(xf_argmax(), right, [1, 3, missing, 2])

# Side note: We use `typemin(Int)` as the initial value of `max` for
# simplicity.  In practice, it should be
# `typemin(eltype(input_array))`.

# We can use filter other than `NotA(Missing)`.  For example, to find
# the index of the largest odd value:

mapfoldl(xf_argmax(Filter(isodd)), right, [1, 4, 3, 2])

# ## Extrema
