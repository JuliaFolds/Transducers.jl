    __foldl__(rf, init, reducible::T)

Left fold a `reducible` with reducing function `rf` and initial value
`init`.  This is primary an API for overloading when the reducible
"container" or "context" (e.g., I/O stream) of type `T` can provide a
better reduction mechanism than the default iterator-based one.

For a simple iterable type `MyType`, a valid implementation is:

```julia
function __foldl__(rf, val, itr::MyType)
    for x in itr
        val = next(rf, val, x)
        @return_if_reduced val
    end
    return complete(rf, val)
end
```

although in this case default ` __foldl__` can handle `MyType` and
thus there is no need for defining it.  In general, defining
`__foldl__` is useful only when there is a better way to go over items
in `reducible` than `Base.iterate`.

    mapfoldl(xf, step, reducible; init, simd) :: T
    transduce(xf, step, init, reducible; simd) :: Union{T, Reduced{T}}

Compose transducer `xf` with reducing step function `step` and reduce
`itr` using it.

!!! note
    `transduce` differs from `mapfoldl` as `Reduced{T}` is returned if
    the transducer `xf` or `step` aborts the reduction.

This API is modeled after $(_cljref("transduce")).

# Arguments
- `xf::Transducer`: A transducer.
- `step`: A callable which accepts 1 or 2 arguments.  If it only
  accepts 2 arguments, wrap it with [`Completing`](@ref) to "add"
  1-argument form (i.e., [`complete`](@ref) protocol).
- `reducible`: A reducible object (array, dictionary, any iterator, etc.).
- `init`: An initial value fed to the first argument to reducing step
  function `step`.
- `simd`: If `true` or `:ivdep`, enable SIMD using `Base.@simd`.  If
  `:ivdep`, use `@simd ivdep for ... end` variant.  Read Julia manual
  of `Base.@simd` to understand when it is appropriate to use this
  option.  For example, `simd = :ivdep` _must not_ be used with stateful
  transducer like [`Scan`](@ref).  This option has no effect if
  `false` (default).

    foreach(eff, xf::Transducer, reducible; simd)
    foreach(eff, ed::Eduction; simd)

Feed the results of `xf` processing items in `reducible` into a unary
function `eff`.  This is useful when the primary computation at the
bottom is the side-effect.  It is also equivalent to `foreach(eff,
eduction(xf, coll))`.  Note that

```julia
foreach(eduction(xf, coll)) do x
    ...
end
```

can be more efficient than

```julia
for x in eduction(xf, coll)
    ...
end
```

as the former does not have to translate the transducer protocol to
the iterator protocol.

`foreach` supports all constructs in the native `for` loop as well as
the enhancements [^julia_issue_22891] to `break` with a value (`break
D(x)` below) and append the `else` clause (`E(x)` below).

[^julia_issue_22891]: See also: [break with value + loop else clauses
    (JuliaLang/julia#22891)](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/22891)

This native `for` loop

```julia
ans = for x in xs
    A(x)
    B(x) && break
    C(x) && break D(x)
else
    E(x)
end
```

can be written as

```julia
ans = foreach(Map(identity), xs) do x
    A(x)
    B(x) && return reduced()
    C(x) && return reduced(D(x))
    x  # required for passing `x` to `E(x)` below
end |> ifunreduced() do x
    E(x)
end
```

See: [`mapfoldl`](@ref), [`reduced`](@ref), [`ifunreduced`](@ref).

!!! compat "Transducers.jl 0.3"

    `foreach` is changed to return what the `do` block (`eff`
    function) returns as-is in version 0.3.  This was required for
    supporting "for-else" (`|> ifunreduced`).  Previously, it only
    supported break-with-value and always applied `unreduced` before
    it returns.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> using Transducers

julia> foreach(eduction(Filter(isodd), 1:4)) do input
           @show input
       end
input = 1
input = 3
3

julia> foreach(Filter(!ismissing), [1, missing, 2, 3]) do input
           @show input
           if iseven(input)
               return reduced()
           end
       end
input = 1
input = 2
Reduced{Nothing}(nothing)
```

It is often useful to append [`|> unreduced`](@ref unreduced) to
unwrap `Reduced` in the final result (note that `|>` here is the
standard function application, not the transducer composition).

```jldoctest; setup = :(using Transducers)
julia> foreach(Filter(!ismissing), [1, missing, 2, 3]) do input
           reduced("got \$input")
       end |> unreduced
"got 1"
```

Combination of break-with-value and for-else is useful for triggering
action after (e.g.) some kind of membership testing failed:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using Transducers)
julia> has2(xs) = foreach(Filter(!ismissing), xs) do input
           input == 2 && reduced(true)
       end |> ifunreduced() do input
           @show input
           false
       end;

julia> has2([1, missing, 2, 3])
true

julia> has2([1, missing])
input = false
false
```

However, note the output `input = false` in the last example.  This is
because how `&&` works in Julia

```jldoctest
julia> false && "otherwise"
false
```

Thus, pure membership testing functions like `has2` above can be
written in a more concise manner:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using Transducers)
julia> simpler_has2(xs) = foreach(Filter(!ismissing), xs) do input
           input == 2 && reduced(true)
       end |> unreduced;

julia> simpler_has2([1, missing, 2, 3])
true

julia> simpler_has2([1, missing])
false
```

Equivalent to [`unreduced(x)`](@ref unreduced) if `x` is a
[`Reduced`](@ref); otherwise run `f(x)`.  Return a curried version if
`x` is not provided.

See: [`foreach`](@ref).

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> using Transducers

julia> 1 |> ifunreduced() do x
           println("called with x = ", x)
       end
called with x = 1

julia> reduced(1) |> ifunreduced() do x
           println("called with x = ", x)
       end
1
```

Notice that nothing is printed in the last example.

# Implementation

```julia
ifunreduced(f) = x -> ifunreduced(f, x)
ifunreduced(f, x::Reduced) = unreduced(x)
ifunreduced(f, x) = f(x)
```

    Channel(xf::Transducer, itr; kwargs...)
    Channel(ed::Eduction; kwargs...)

Pipe items from an iterable `itr` processed by the transducer `xf`
through a channel.  `Channel(xf, itr)` and `Channel(eduction(xf,
itr))` are equivalent.  Note that `itr` itself can be a `Channel`.

Keyword arguments are passed to `Channel(function; kwargs...)`.
`ctype` is inferred from `xf` if not specified.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> using Transducers

julia> ch1 = Channel(Filter(isodd), 1:5);

julia> ch2 = Channel(Map(x -> 2x - 1), ch1);

julia> ed = eduction(Map(x -> 1:x), ch2);

julia> ch3 = Channel(Cat(), ed);

julia> typeof(ch1) === typeof(ch2) === typeof(ch3) === Channel{Int}
true

julia> foreach(PartitionBy(isequal(1)), ch3) do input

input = [1, 1]
input = [2, 3, 4, 5]
